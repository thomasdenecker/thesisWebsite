### Abstract

Candida glabrata is a cause of life-threatening invasive infections especially in elderly and immunocompromised patients. Part of human digestive and urogenital microbiota, C. glabrata faces varying iron availability, low during infection or high in digestive and urogenital tracts. To maintain its homeostasis, C. glabrata must get enough iron for essential cellular processes and resist toxic iron excess. The response of this pathogen to both depletion and lethal excess of iron at 30°C have been described in the literature using different strains and iron sources. However, adaptation to iron variations at 37°C, the human body temperature and to gentle overload, is poorly known. In this study, we performed transcriptomic experiments at 30°C and 37°C with low and high but sub-lethal ferrous concentrations. We identified iron responsive genes and clarified the potential effect of temperature on iron homeostasis. Our exploration of the datasets was facilitated by the inference of functional networks of co-expressed genes, which can be accessed through a web interface. Relying on stringent selection and independently of existing knowledge, we characterized a list of 214 genes as key elements of C. glabrata iron homeostasis and interesting candidates for medical applications.
